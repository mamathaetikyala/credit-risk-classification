# credit-risk-classification - background

In this Challenge, demonstrate various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company is used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## About

Using knowledge of the imbalanced-learn library, a logistic regression model is used to compare two versions of the dataset. First, use the original dataset. Second, resample the data by using the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library.

For both cases, get the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.
The purpose of this study is to compare the weather condiitions across the globe for random 600+ cities.
