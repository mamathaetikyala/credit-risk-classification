# credit-risk-classification - background

In this Challenge, demonstrate various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company is used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## About

Using knowledge of the imbalanced-learn library, a logistic regression model is used to compare two versions of the dataset. First, use the original dataset. Second, resample the data by using the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library.

For both cases, get the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.
The purpose of this study is to compare the weather condiitions across the globe for random 600+ cities.

## Overview of the Analysis

Analysis completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* purpose of the analysis: 
Demonstrate various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk.


* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
